This script is for Fedora. These instructions assume that you're able to log into the local host via ssh.

Add your own variables to puppet-master-vars.yml and run with ansible-playbook, e.g.

ansible-playbook puppet-master-vars.yml -u user -k -K

This will generate a new file, "puppet-master-setup.yml" with the variables you specified. Run this with ansible-playbook.
